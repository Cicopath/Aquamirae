##### All Rights Reserved unless otherwise explicitly stated.

----------

This document outlines the terms of fair use of intellectual property, including ideas, names, code, models, textures, and sounds, collectively comprising the modification 'Aquamirae' (hereinafter referred to as the MOD) for the video game 'Minecraft'. All assets and ideas present in the mod are the property of the individual known as 'Obscuria', with the following exceptions: code outside of the 'com.obscuria' package, code annotated through comments or filenames to credit another author, and sound assets edited from other media (specifics are listed in the 'Credits' section of the mod description on Curseforge).

Cases of private use do not fall under the purview of this license. This includes standard modded play, private mod-packs, or customization through configuration files or direct editing of modded contents as long as the project, associated files, or related media content (e.g. YouTube videos) are not made available to the public. Any use of MOD's intellectual property that is distributed or made available to the public (via downloads, screenshots, video media platforms, etc.) becomes subject to the constraints presented in this license.

### Credit Constraints
All use of MOD's intellectual property must credit the original mod by name with some form of access or direction to the official mod page on Curseforge. Distributors may not claim authorship or ownership of MOD's intellectual property.

### Profitability Constraints
Direct sale of MOD's content or assets is strictly prohibited. Ad revenue and download-link revenue is acceptable provided all other terms of this license are met.

### Non-Compete
For projects utilizing MOD's ideas, code, or assets, direct competition with the original mod is not permitted. A project is considered in competition with MOD if it offers players gameplay features or interactive content from MOD on the Minecraft Java Edition platform. Mod-packs are exempt from this clause as long as they contain a sufficiently large amount of content to warrant the redistribution of MOD files for ease of installation.

### Non-Imitate
Projects not directly utilizing the complete original mod may not present themselves as affiliated with the official mod. Such projects must denote their status by including the phrase "Unofficial", "Fan-made", or any other equivalent language somewhere clear and readable to players on any platform showcasing the project.

### Non-Manipulate
Alterations to the ideas, assets, and source code from MOD are permitted as long as such changes remain faithful to the source material. This can include integration with mod-packs or story-related changes for mod-packs, adventure maps, and video content. Exceptions to this clause can be made on a case-by-case basis; please contact Obscuria if you are planning more drastic changes to MOD for a project.

The author of Aquamirae, Obscuria, reserves the right to alter this license as necessary to protect their work in the future.
